 * mirror. Rendering over a store that has not been hydrated is rendering a
 * spinner for something the tab already had.
 *
 * This page holds its credential, which is what `auth.Plain` needs and what a
 * sandbox and tests use. `session.tsx` beside it is the same page signed in by
 * a session cookie, for once `serve.go` serves `auth/authsession` -- point
 * `index.html` at it then, and this file can go.
