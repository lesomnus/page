// Telemetry builds what this app's `otel:` describes and puts it on the
// context, answering with that context and what shuts it down.
//
// It is written here rather than done by payday, and that is the same decision
// `cmd/serve.go` makes about the stack: the order is load-bearing and belongs
// where it can be read. `Build` answers with a **new context**, and everything
// that logs, traces or measures reads the providers off it -- so this has to
// happen before `cmd.Build`, and a reader has to be able to see that it does.
//
// # What it costs to leave out
//
// Silence, and nothing else. `grpcx` puts a request logger and a tracer on
// every server it builds, both read from `otx.From(ctx)`, and `otx.From`
// answers a context carrying nothing with the OpenTelemetry globals -- which
// discard what they are given. The app serves, every call succeeds, and there
// is no log anywhere.
//
// It is worth knowing that this happened: an app shipped with `otel:` in its
// configuration and these three calls missing, and what found it was somebody
// wondering where the request log had gone. `grpcx` says so on stderr now,
// once, which is the only channel left when the log is the broken thing.
//
// # In the sandbox
//
// The same three calls, in `wasm/main.go`, with no configuration to read: the
// defaults give the pretty exporter, and on Wasm that writes to the browser's
// console rather than to a stderr nothing reads. The request logger is named
// there rather than through `grpcx`, since a message port has no
// `grpc.ServerOption`.
